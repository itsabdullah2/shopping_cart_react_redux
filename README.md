## üõíShopping Cart

A Shopping Cart with React Redux and JavaScript. I built a side project for learning how to add products to the cart and knew how this process works in e-commerce websites. The app is responsive. So, I focused on the functionalities side and responsive side.

## üì¶ Technologies

- React-Redux
- Redux
- React
- JavaScript
- TailwindCSS
- React Router
- gh-pages (For deploying the project on GitHub)
- daisyui

## üéØ Features

- When you add the product in the cart you get a notification.
- When you add the same product twice to the cart the product will increase by one.
- In the cart page you can delete the product, Increase, and decrease the product and for sure the price changes every time you change the quantity, and the total cost changes.
- You will remove the product if the quantity equal to zero.
- You can remove the product from cart and when you remove it you will get a notification.

## üë©‚Äçüç≥ The Process

I started to search for the idea and how I could implement it I used ChatGPT, Stack Overflow, and MDN, and I watched some YouTube videos to get more information.

Next, I typed all the Ideas about the project and I typed them as steps. And, I started to implement the idea and write code. (I usually write code after organizing the ideas of any project I'll work on and after searching if there are any updates in the technologies that I'll use).

Finally, I tested the functionalities and the responsiveness of the project.

This way, I understand what I've built and learn a lot of things from bugs and I expand my knowledge.

## üìö What I Learned

- During this project, I learned how to maintain the state of the entire application in a single centralized store. This makes it easier to manage and control the state of the application.
- Also, I can share state between components without passing props, and React-Redux helps me to organize my code in a more structured way.

## üíª Demo:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
